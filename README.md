A tool to make sure alerts don't go unnoticed.

Provides a clear dashboard of fired Prometheus alerts with the option to dismiss them. Also makes a hell of a noise.

Meant to be used with: https://github.com/12urenloop/monitoring


## Getting started

1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
2. Run the webserver: `make run`
